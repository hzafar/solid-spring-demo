# Solid Spring Demo

A simple Solid application that can read and write pod data, built using Spring and Kotlin. To run, clone the repository and execute `./mvnw spring-boot:run` from the repository root. The application will start up on http://localhost:8080.

This application demonstrates how to implement the [Solid OIDC flow](https://solid.github.io/authentication-panel/solid-oidc/) (to my best ability and understanding) using [Spring](https://spring.io/).
